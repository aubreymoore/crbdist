# Visualizing the invasion history of the coconut rhinoceros beetle

This project was inspired by Steve Bennet's blog post entitled [Super lightweight map websites with Github](https://stevebennett.me/2014/02/13/super-lightweight-map-websites/).

Output is an online map visualizing the invasion history of the coconut rhinoceros beetle, *Oryctes rhinoceros*, a major pest of coconut and oil palms. The map can be seen on [this GitHub page](http://aubreymoore.github.io/crbdist/mymap.html).
