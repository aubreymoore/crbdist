# Visualizing invasion history of the coconut rhinoceros beetle

This project generates an interactive, online map to visualize the invasion history of the coconut rhinoceros beetle, *Oryctes rhinoceros*, a major pest of coconut and oil palms. The map can be seen on [this GitHub page](http://aubreymoore.github.io/crbdist/mymap.html).

This project was inspired by Steve Bennet's blog post entitled [Super lightweight map websites with Github](https://stevebennett.me/2014/02/13/super-lightweight-map-websites/).

All data are stored in a GEOJSON text file, **map.geojson**. Note that longitudes must be in the range of 0 to 360 degrees (i.e. 170.0E is entered as 190.0 degrees).
